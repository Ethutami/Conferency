# Conferency
Conferency is a fully self-developed event management and ticketing platform, created as a personal portfolio project. It is designed to facilitate the organization and purchase of various events, including conferences, webinars, educational classes, and offline seminars.

I handled the entire development process independently â€” from UI/UX design in Figma, to building the frontend using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I also developed the backend and database architecture from scratch, ensuring complete control over the application's structure and functionality.

Conferency offers a streamlined, user-friendly experience tailored for event organizers who seek an efficient and scalable digital solution.
